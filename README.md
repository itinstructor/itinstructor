🔭 I’m currently working on projects with GoPiGo3, Raspberry Pi, Grove Sensors, Arduino, Python, Google Colab, C++, Visual C#, Unity and Java.

“If you think it's simple, then you have misunderstood the problem.” — Bjarne Stroustrup, Creator of C++

⚡ Fun fact: I used to play trumpet and sing in a polka band. :guitar:
